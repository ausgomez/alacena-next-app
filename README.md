## ü•° Story

So in 2020 created a [Vue App](https://github.com/ausgomez/alacena-vue-3) a while a back using [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to fetch recipes and find new ones based on your ingredients available.

I am recreating the same app but using a whole different stack, but same idea.

I want to give it a try to Next 13 and see if is really that cool.

But first let's ask [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to write me a nice elevator pitch for this app:

## ü§ñ Elevator pitch

Are you tired of cooking the same old meals every day? Do you want to try something new and exciting in the kitchen? Look no further than my new Next.js app!

This app is designed to help you discover delicious and interesting recipes online. With a sleek and intuitive interface, you can easily search for recipes by ingredient, cuisine, or dietary restrictions.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Tech Stack

So here is the stack I am using for this app:

- Giving a try to the new [Next 13](https://nextjs.org)
- I picked [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as my UI Framework
- I am using [Chakra Themes](https://chakra-templates.dev/) for fast development

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Functions
